# Profile

While developing algorithms in Labview and C during my University degree projects, I acquired a keen interest in programming. Having worked as a chemical analyst for 5-6 years, I took the opportunity to change my career and become a programmer. After an initial evaluation, I was selected for the FDM Academy in the City of London to pursue this interest and train as a Java Developer. 

Upon completing the initial training phase, I gained experience working at Waitrose, BNP Paribas, and Thomson Reuters. Primarily focusing on web applications, I built up my skills and technical knowledge in developing with server-side Java, client-side JavaScript, and back-end databases.

I was one of a small group of trainees at the academy selected to join a course programme in “Applied Computing” at the University of Sussex. Upon completion, I obtained a Postgraduate Certificate with distinction.
