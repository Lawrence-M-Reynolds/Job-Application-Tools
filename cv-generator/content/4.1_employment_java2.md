## Open GI -- Lead Software Engineer (Sep 2024 -- Aug 2025)
*Worcester, United Kingdom*

I joined as one of the Lead Java developers of a spring project that processes payments for insurance products. The task was to add the functionality to create/update "pay-by-links". This allowed payment links to be sent to customers to pay via the payment provider’s website. Tasks undertaken:

- Adapted a shared library that had only previously been used for POST SOAP requests to be used for Restful services. This allowed the HTTP method and resource path to be specified.
- Created MySql scripts for adding new tables and stored procedures.
- Developed a method to test the rollback scripts by comparing SQL dumps of the database before and after.
- Added a new SOAP end-point to process messages from back-end systems.
