## IG Index -- Senior Software Developer (Apr 2022 -- May 2024)

*London, United Kingdom*

I took the role of one of the lead AEM developers for the main IG.com website.

**AEM 6.4 to 6.5 migration**

- Took the lead on relocating the “designs” data during the migration from AEM 6.4 to 6.5. This relocation from ‘/etc’ to ‘/apps’ in the JCR involved meticulous verification and migration of many custom components and customisations. I created an Ondeploy script in Java to update many references.
- Took the lead on planning and executing the migration of many custom components and functionality. Container components such as tabs and accordions were particularly complicated, and this was solved by following the implementation of similar components in the Adobe Core Components package. The JavaScript was particularly complex, and after completing the process once, it was then presented to the front-end team so they could continue with the other components.

**Development of New Features and Performance/Support fixes**

- Introduced the use of ACS Commons Ondeploy scripts to carry out extensive content updates. After writing the first script for the “designs” data migration, I refactored it so other team members could easily use it. They could simply “plug in” custom functionality without understanding the entire framework.
- Proposed and implemented the use of URL selectors in place of parameters for specific servlet calls, allowing the response to be cached. Configuration was added so that TTL headers returned from AEM would be respected to prevent old data from being served. The change was implemented to be backwards compatible, avoiding blocks from other teams. The response times reported by the consumers of the end-points showed a significant improvement.
- Identified and fixed a long-running performance issue that was affecting the whole site. The page content would typically have a very deep level of nested nodes. An investigation revealed that it resulted in redundant but very expensive queries in the back end. A method invocation in one of the JSPs was found to be the leading cause, and after removing this, the page load speed and CPU usage were significantly improved.
- Identified the cause of AEM server crashes occurring in the test environment. Evaluation of stack traces revealed a deadlock in one of the servlets, which would occur with a particular configuration page content.
- Created various Splunk queries to analyse the logs and identify issues such as long-running requests.
- Assisting front-end developers with JavaScript-related issues.

**Other**

- Assisted other developers by writing detailed and concise documentation of processes that had been forgotten within the team.

## Digitalum -- Senior AEM Developer (Feb 2020 -- Apr 2022)

*Lummen, Belgium*

**Bridgestone Ecommerce Website**

I worked in a small team to create a new e-commerce website for Bridgestone, a company that sells tyres under various brands—the first site to be released in France for their First Stop tyre service brand.
Our team integrated the AEM website with their new commerce back-end, developed simultaneously using Magento. We’re interacting with it via GraphQL calls. Achievements:

- Developed back-end AEM Java code. For example, I added a servlet to act as an end-point to interact with the DriveRight API, which allowed vehicles to be looked up based on the licence plate.
- Worked on various front-end tasks, including vanilla JavaScript and React with Apollo which were used for e-commerce functionality.
- One of the back-end tasks was to implement a retriever for a custom entity created in Magento. The code OOB code was not very extendable. To resolve this, I had to implement many lambdas in Java.
- The delegate pattern had to be used with some commerce integration code. I contributed to a thread on how to test this in the Adobe AEM forum.

**Yamaha Motor Ecommerce Website**

I worked with a team of three to develop new features for the Yamaha website, where customers could purchase motorbike-related apparel and accessories. This involved working with the AEM back-end, the front-end HTML/JavaScript, and AWS lambdas, which were written in TypeScript/JavaScript. Achievements:

- Replaced the Adobe CIF code with custom lambdas to interact with the back-end Commerce Tools system.
- Displaying related items for different products using custom fields set in Commerce Tools.
- Developing changes for the Vue Components that listed products.
- Introduced the product discount features to the website.
- Used the Groovy console to make updates to properties in the AEM JCR.

**Firestone Ecommerce Website**

I worked with a team of four to set up a new corporate website for the client. Tasks included setting up the analytics, caching servers and developing various components within AEM. Achievements:

- Set up the dispatcher and varnish servers, set up the sling mappings, and planned the deployment processes within the customer’s environment. Developed various AEM components for the site.
- Taking on assigned development tasks such as the social share component that allowed the settings to be inherited throughout the child pages.
- Setting up the dispatchers along with the Varnish configuration. This had to be done within the client’s environment, which had a strict process. As much of this was not documented, I had to liaise with the business to get the required technical information and to understand the process.

**Bose Ecommerce Website**

Enhance and optimise the existing retail site following the development of another external team. Achievements:

- Enhancing various components that set links so that authors could specify URL parameters to append. This change was applied to the rich text plugin and other components using the pathfield dialog component.
- Enhanced the rollout configurations so that internal site URLs would be translated appropriately.
- Migrated the logic to process Hybris product data imports to a Kafka consumer class. This involved translating from an old API to a new one that had been developed so that the old import process could still be used.

## IBM iX -- Senior AEM Developer (Oct 2018 -- Jan 2020)

*Bracknell, United Kingdom*

Took a lead role on a project to implement a website in AEM for NSK with a large team. Having rapidly picked up speed with the project, I took significant ownership for mentoring less experienced developers and conducting code reviews. Tasks undertaken:

- Configured dispatchers (Apache caches), including the use of TTL instead of the usual AEM flush mechanism.
- Identified critical issues at code review regarding threading, logging, and security.
- Led a project to create a tool that would analyse components on an AEM instance and automatically generate example pages.
- Developed complex AEM Workflows for multi-lingual translation and review, integrating a customized 'page diff' tool to streamline the editorial approval process.
- Developed a forms component utilizing Sling Servlets and requiring complex back-end validation, secure data processing, and automated email integration.
- Developed content fragments for scheduling customer events that could be displayed on the main website and add to site visitors' calendars.
- Prototyped a headless AEM implementation with React. [Contributed an approved solution to using Experience Fragments to the official Adobe forum](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager/aem-6-4-with-spa-editor-how-to-use-the-experience-fragments/td-p/322742).
- Identified and applied optimisations, notably improving a front-end JavaScript search component by reducing the number of asynchronous calls to fetch data from the back-end servlet.
