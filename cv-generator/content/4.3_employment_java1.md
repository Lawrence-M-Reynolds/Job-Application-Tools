## Thomson Reuters -- Java Developer (Sep 2014 -- Mar 2016)

*London, United Kingdom*

Joined the team to work on implementing a new court management (CMS) and electronic filing (EFile) system in the Royal Courts of Justice. These are built upon products that are still under development in the US.

- With CMS’s first release, I was given several bugs to fix so that I could understand how the system works. Having successfully resolved many issues, I was paired with another developer to implement the EFile system. This involved modifying the configuration and making code changes to a partially built generic version of the project to conform to the business requirements of the Royal Courts of Justice. This includes:
- Setting up the configuration so the application would work against an Oracle database rather than MSSQL.
- Configuring and implementing code changes for the different pages and web-flow.
- Configuring the communication between the CMS and EFile systems and implementing the necessary code changes.
- Investigating, documenting and developing features specific to the RCJ:
  + Implementing part of the payment system to allow customers to provide an account number.
  + Allowing case parties to be added to a filing for a case.
  + Allowing law firms to be associated with multiple addresses and the data to be synchronised between the Efile and CMS systems.
- Taking part as one of the tech leads for a CMS/Efile release. I was responsible for preparing database scripts, including changes to the core product. This was more complex than previous releases because Liquibase had been introduced. Some of the dependent projects had also been merged, so additional changes to the database were required.
- Fixing bugs from the ongoing development in the US. Examples:
  + Fixing a customised spring BeanWrapper, which was incorrectly binding values from specific date fields to the page form.
  + Fixing Hibernate queries and stored procedures (both Oracle and SQL Server).
- Liaising and supporting the US team to resolve issues with the code and bugs.
