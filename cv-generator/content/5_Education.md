Created an application to aid music students in learning the compositional technique of counterpoint. The algorithm finds solutions to how melodic lines can be written alongside one another according to strict rules. The application consists of:

* Classes representing the various musical entities such as the key, scale, and chords.
* An interface for the user to write music into a composition object. This involved mapping elements in the composition object to points on the interface so that a listener could then detect whether a user had written a new note or rest event. Changes to the composition object were then applied by a manager class containing the logic to handle the creation of new notes or rests.
* A class to evaluate compositions based on the various rules of counterpoint. This was implemented using the command design pattern, with the rules as the commands.
* A class to generate solutions to the counterpoint exercises. First, this had to determine all possibilities for a given key and other limiting factors. It then used the evaluation class to grade each solution so the user could check those with the highest score.
* Implementing the Java Sound API to produce playback of the written composition.
