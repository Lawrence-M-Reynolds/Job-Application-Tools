## IG Index -- Senior Software Developer (Apr 2022 -- May 2024)

*London, United Kingdom*

Lead AEM Back-end Java Developer for the high-traffic IG.com platform. Managed and developed the strategy to complete the version upgrade of the AEM platform (6.4 to 6.5).

**AEM 6.4 to 6.5 migration**

- Created a sophisticated implementation of an ACS Commons Ondeploy script to migrate the “designs” data from ‘/etc’ to ‘/apps’ in the JCR. Thorough and well planned testing led to a zero-defect production release.
- Led the planning and execution of the custom components and functionality migration, notably refactoring container components (tabs, accordions) to align with the Adobe Core Components standard.
- Guided other developers on how to migrate component dialogs, including the migration of the WYSIWYG component.

**Development of New Features and Performance/Support fixes**

- Mentored other developers on how to utilise the Sling and OSGi frameworks as well as the Apache Jackrabbit content repository.
- Adapted and refactored the Ondeploy script used in the migration to make other repository content changes. This replaced an existing python script that was increasing HTTP traffic due to API calls as well as leading to data inconsistencies between servers.
- Proposed and implemented a new caching strategy using Sling URL selectors to replace legacy parameter-based calls. This enabled Apache HTTP Server caching via TTL headers instead of the standard AEM flush mechanism, significantly improving API response times.
- Diagnosed a severe performance bottleneck affecting content authors by isolating a recursive JSP method that triggered redundant, high-cost backend queries. Eliminating this method call significantly reduced CPU usage and improved page load speeds.
- Diagnosed critical test environment crashes using Splunk log analysis to pinpoint and resolve a Servlet deadlock.
- Guided front-end developers with JavaScript, NPM build, and AEM script configuration issues.
- Identified and bridged a critical infrastructure knowledge gap within the team by reverse-engineering the server configuration. Created comprehensive technical documentation on the configuration and the deployment processes.
- Created various Splunk queries to analyse the logs for general diagnostics and to identify issues such as long-running requests.

## Digitalum -- Senior Java Developer (Feb 2020 -- Apr 2022)

*Lummen, Belgium*

**Bridgestone Ecommerce Website**

Delivered the brand's first e-commerce rollout in France ("First Stop"), integrating AEM with a Magento backend via GraphQL.

- Developed back-end AEM Java code. For example, I added a servlet to act as an end-point to interact with the DriveRight API, which allowed vehicles to be looked up based on the licence plate.
- One of the back-end tasks was to implement a retriever for a custom entity created in Magento. The OOB code was not very extendable. To resolve this, I had to implement many lambdas in Java.
- Implemented the "Delegate Pattern" required for some of the commerce integration code. I contributed to a thread on how to test this in the Adobe AEM forum.
- Worked on various front-end tasks, including vanilla JavaScript and React with Apollo which were used for e-commerce functionality.

**Yamaha Motor Ecommerce Website**

Developed full-stack features for the apparel e-commerce platform using AEM, HTML/JS, and AWS Serverless architecture.

- Replaced the Adobe CIF code with custom AWS Lambdas to interact with the back-end Commerce Tools system.
- Developed new features including: displaying related items for different products using custom fields set in Commerce Tools, and building Vue.js product listings.
- Introduced the product discount features to the website.
- Used the Groovy console to make updates to properties in the AEM JCR.
- Refactored complex front-end JavaScript and recovered an inconsistent git repository due to missing commits from a previous migration.

**Firestone Ecommerce Website**

Established the corporate website infrastructure, coordinating directly with client teams to define deployment strategies.

- Planned and documented the deployment process for the client's infrastructure team to follow.
- Configured the Sling mappings in AEM and aligned them with the dispatcher configurations.
- Developed 'Inheritance-aware' components (e.g., Social Share), enabling child pages to dynamically inherit configuration from parent nodes.
- Set up the dispatchers along with the Varnish configuration within the client’s environment, having liaised with their team to gather the required information regarding the existing infrastructure process.

**Bose Ecommerce Website**

Optimized the existing retail site and led the migration from AEM 5.6 to 6.5.

- Developed various components that set links so that authors could specify URL parameters to append. This change was applied to the rich text plugin and other components using the pathfield dialog component.
- Updated and developed components for the AEM 6.5 migration. Notably guiding the front-end team using experience from Black Sun with migrating the WYSIWYG component which had notoriously complex configuration and JavaScript.
- Diagnosed and resolved a critical server-side defect caused by Edge Side Includes (ESI) in the Dispatcher, which created inconsistencies with backend Java logic.
- Optimized Multi-Site Manager (MSM) rollout configurations to ensure correct URL translation and localization across internal site variations.
- Migrated the logic to process Hybris product data imports to a Kafka consumer class. This involved translating from an old API to a new one that had been developed so that the old import process could still be used.
- Resolved complex security configuration issues, notably diagnosing missing role privileges for administrative staff.
- Designed and implemented a custom Error Monitoring Dashboard, allowing administrators to view error messages occurring from failed Kafka messages.

## IBM iX -- Senior Java Developer (Oct 2018 -- Jan 2020)

*Bracknell, United Kingdom*

Took a lead role on a project to implement a website in AEM for NSK with a large team. Having rapidly picked up speed with the project, I took significant ownership for mentoring less experienced developers and conducting code reviews. Tasks undertaken:

- Configured dispatchers (Apache caches), including the use of TTL instead of the usual AEM flush mechanism.
- Identified critical issues at code review regarding threading, logging, and security.
- Led a project to create a tool that would analyse components on an AEM instance and automatically generate example pages.
- Developed complex AEM Workflows for multi-lingual translation and review, integrating a customized 'page diff' tool to streamline the editorial approval process.
- Developed a forms component utilizing Sling Servlets and requiring complex back-end validation, secure data processing, and automated email integration.
- Developed content fragments for scheduling customer events that could be displayed on the main website and add to site visitors' calendars.
- Prototyped a headless AEM implementation with React. [Contributed an approved solution to using Experience Fragments to the official Adobe forum](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager/aem-6-4-with-spa-editor-how-to-use-the-experience-fragments/td-p/322742).
- Identified and applied optimisations, notably improving a front-end JavaScript search component by reducing the number of asynchronous calls to fetch data from the back-end servlet.
